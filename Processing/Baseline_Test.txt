BEGIN

And blood-black nothingness began to spin... 

A system of cells interlinked 
within cells interlinked 
within cells interlinked within one stem... 

And dreadfully distinct against the dark, 
a tall white fountain played.

Cells.

Cells.

Have you ever been in an institution? Cells...

Cells.

Do they keep you in a cell? Cells...

Cells.

When you're not performing your duties, 
do they keep you in a little box? Cells...

Cells.

Interlinked.

Interlinked.

What's it like to hold the hand 
of someone you love? Interlinked...

Interlinked.

Did they teach you 
how to feel finger to finger? Interlinked...

Interlinked.

Do you long for having your heart interlinked? Interlinked...

Interlinked.

Do you dream about being interlinked?

Interlinked.

What's it like to hold your child in your arms? Interlinked...

Interlinked.

Do you feel that there's a part of you that's missing? Interlinked...

Interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.

Why don't you say that three times?: Within cells interlinked...

Within cells interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.

Within cells interlinked.
